## What is Unlimited Forest (name TBD)?
I want it to at it's very core just be a semi animal crossing / webfishing-esque, procedural generated 3d forest that the player can walk around in. A 3rd person camera is the goal. My laptop is crap too so optimization is key.

The goal more or less is to get my first game built from scratch to gain an understanding of game engines and graphics processing. And honestly also because it sounds cool af. I plan to use the following technologies...\

- C (language)
- SLD (Simple DirectMedia Layer) 
	- window creation 
	- input handling
	- event management
	- audio handling
	- basic rendering
- OpenGL 4.6
	- transformations
	- shading 
	- texture mapping
	- geometric manipulation
	- rendering 3d stuffs, idk... yet
- Probably Blender as well, we'll see when we get there
